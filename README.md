# Thesis_scripts
Scripts used in thesis analyses of images in chapter 3 and 4 of the written thesis

# 01 Olga_Random_Points.py
This script contains code used to generate random points in images for testing spatial relationships between NN points

# 02 NN_analysis_A1_V6.ipynb
This script contains code used to perform NND analysis (This script is used in both RNA-FISH and BRU experiments)

# 03 FI_analysis_A1_V3_.ipynb
This script contains code used to perform Fluorescence intensity analysis (This script is used in both RNA-FISH and BRU experiments)

# 04 Cytb_2cell_FI_analysis_example_data
This directory contains example data and outputs from Fluorescence intensity analyses (Example input/output data is formated the same way between BRU and RNA-FISH expriments, only RNA-FISH example is provided)

# 05 Cytb_MetI_NND_analysis_example_data
This directory contains example data and outputs from Nearest Neighbor Distance (NND) analyses (Example input/output data is formated the same way between BRU and RNA-FISH expriments, only RNA-FISH example is provided)
